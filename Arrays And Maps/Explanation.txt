

These have an updated syntax and code generation for arrays and maps. 

They have implemented the following:
1. Array representation
2. Access array elements
3. QuickAssign Array
4. QuickDeclare Array
5. Map declaration (Code)

Missing these features
5. Access map layers
6. Combine maps



The bug(elephant) in the room
My syntax has been really poorly made, because I assumed Antlr would contextualize its tokens in a different way.
This bold and ambitious assumption lead me to make several elements that are VERY alike
Because of this it generates the wrong tokens, which means when the code visists it is with the wrong intent. 

Currently layer declarations get confused for baseDeclarations, and tokens are created as such. 

Example:

map[2][2] myMap = {int locked};

Is split into

mapDeclaration: --> map[2][2] myMap = { <--
baseDeclaration: --> int locked}; <--


Proposed solution:
Since the syntax for the two of them are so similar, and have to be similar, I suggest they become the same. And then baseDeclaration does something different.

baseDeclaration : declarationLayout                     //Basic

'{' declarationLayout (';' declarationLayout)*'}'       //layers


This way should solve the problem (I think). I will be trying this when I get the time. Have a gorgeous week and best of luckk!!!
